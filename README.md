To build this solution I used google collab, I will be sepearting the code in the blocks I executed in google collab.
To aid in the assitance of building this system I used claude AI and chatGpt as well as looking at various websites and adapting the code through trial and error for the natural language processing.

Step 1:
Run 1st block, installing necessary libaries.

Step 2:
Run the 2nd block, click choose files, then select the all the pdf's, this is so the files can be saved directly into google collab, however
it does mean this process has to be done manually once the program is reset.

Step 3:
Run the 3rd block, convert all the pdfs into jpgs (as this is the format they are needed in for my program)

Step 4:
Run the 4th block, this will take some time to complete, but will try and output the required information from the images which were given.
